# AI PRD Builder Web - Context Summary

## Current State
âœ… **Clean Architecture foundation is COMPLETE and follows SOLID principles**

## What's Been Built
- **Domain Layer**: Pure entities, value objects, repository interfaces
- **Application Layer**: Use cases for all business operations
- **Infrastructure Layer**: API client, WebSocket client with reconnection
- **Dependency Injection**: Centralized DIContainer for proper injection

## What Remains
**React UI components only** - All business logic is ready.

## Next Steps
ðŸ“– **Read `TODO.md` for detailed implementation tasks**

The TODO file contains:
- Complete checklist of remaining React hooks and components
- Step-by-step implementation guide
- Testing checklist
- Architecture principles summary

## Quick Start
1. Read `TODO.md`
2. Implement custom hooks first (foundation)
3. Build React components (bottom-up)
4. Wire everything in `App.tsx` and `main.tsx`
5. Test against running Vapor server on port 8080

All architectural decisions have been made. Just follow the TODO.
